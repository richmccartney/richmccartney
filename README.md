# Hi there, I'm Richard 👋 👨‍💻
I'm a frontend developer and product designer currently working at <a href='https://ba.com'>British Airways</a>. I am passionate about design systems and accessibility. Delving into the world to create helpful systems not for the developers but for those who use it. I love working with CSS, JavaScript, ReactJS and most recently Web Components + StencilJS.
