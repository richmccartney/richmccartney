# Hi there, I'm Richard 👋 👨‍💻
I'm a frontend developer and product designer currently working at <a href='https://bt.com'>BT Plc</a>. I am passionate about design systems and accessibility. I love delving into the world of creating helpful systems that scale only not for the developers but for those who use it. I love working with CSS/SCSS, JavaScript, ReactJS and most recently Web Components + StencilJS.
